                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>De-escalation:</strong> A subject is verbally non-compliant and agitated but is not armed and has not made physical threats. Instead of immediately moving to physical control, you <span class="text-cyan-300">maintain a safe distance</span>, use a calm tone, and ask open-ended questions to understand the issue, giving them time to comply.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reasonableness:</strong> You confront a suspect who just committed an armed robbery. The suspect refuses commands and reaches for their waistband. Your decision to draw your firearm is based on the <span class="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">totality of the circumstances</span>: the severity of the crime (violent felony) and the suspect's actions posing an imminent threat.</li>
